# rtylr Self-Host Architecture

This repository is an installer and runtime orchestrator. It does not contain
product source code. The source repositories build public Docker images, and
this repo wires those images together for a customer-owned deployment via two
supported install paths: a **Helm chart** (primary) and **Docker Compose**.

## Runtime Shape

```
browser
  |
  v
ingress / caddy proxy
  |-- auth | dash | pos | erp | hr | crm | finance      (frontends, :8080)
  |   flow | insights | recruit | menu | docs
  |-- api:9999
  |-- upload:8080

api / worker / upload
  |-- MySQL                 (bundled local OR bring-your-own)
  |-- Redis                 (bundled local OR bring-your-own)
  |-- floci object storage  (bundled local OR bring-your-own S3-compatible)
  |
  +--> https://license.voxire.com   (ONLY external dependency)
```

The upload service is intentionally separate from the API service. Uploads
route to the upload service (the self-host analog of `cdn.voxire.com`, reached
via the configurable `UPLOAD_URL`); the API only stores and reads media
metadata.

## Self-Sustaining Stack

The stack is self-contained by default. A customer may bring their own MySQL,
Redis, and S3-compatible object storage by pointing `DB_HOST`, `REDIS_URL`, and
`S3_*` at their services. If they do not, the stack spins up local MySQL, Redis,
and **floci** (local S3-compatible object storage, bucket created by
`floci/init/create-bucket.sh`).

- **Compose**: local infra is gated behind the `local-infra` profile.
- **Helm**: local infra is gated behind `localInfra.{mysql,redis,floci}.enabled`.

The only thing the stack ever reaches on the public internet is the hosted
license authority `https://license.voxire.com`.

## License Flow

Self-hosted customers receive a license key from Voxire sales and set it as
`RTYLR_LICENSE_KEY`. The backend `api` validates that key against the hosted
authority `https://license.voxire.com`. That authority URL is hardcoded in the
backend and is **not** customer-configurable. There is **no local license
service** in the self-host stack. See [license.md](license.md) for details.

## Configuration

Every app URL is configurable (`AUTH_URL`, `DASH_URL`, `POS_URL`, `ERP_URL`,
`HR_URL`, `CRM_URL`, `FINANCE_URL`, `FLOW_URL`, `INSIGHTS_URL`, `RECRUIT_URL`,
`MENU_URL`, `API_URL`, `UPLOAD_URL`). The backend derives
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` from the configured frontend URLs. No hosted domains are
hardcoded in any image.
